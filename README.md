# python-reminders
Some Python programming reminders from when learning Python 3.

To run any of the scripts using Anaconda

```
conda create -n reminders
conda activate reminders
conda install numpy pympler
conda install -c conda-forge memory_profiler objgraph
pip install guppy3
```

then you can run any of the scripts, for example ```python basic\1_structure.py```

Tested with Python 3.8.2 on Windows 10 Pro. Note that some constructs will not be compatible with earlier
versions of Python, especially Python 2.x.
